2,"The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .",1,Reddit

8,"EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of "" teammate "" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is "" allied "" to two others and "" opposed "" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses ?€? for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( "" weenies "" ) that can be used right away and "" buff""-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) "" tutor "" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , "" fatties "" ) rather than with cheap ones ( "" weenies "" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or "" EDH "" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your "" commander "" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( "" Friday Night Magic "" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or "" mythic rare "" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the "" Deck - builder 's toolkit "" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of "" proxy "" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .",1,Reddit

13,"I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)",1,Reddit

22,"Sometimes it 's for legal reasons . For example , there was already a Burger King restaurant in Australia , so in order to avoid violating the other restaurant 's trademark , Burger King was re - branded as Hungry Jack 's ( which it 's still called in Australia today ) . Other times the name is changed because it historical / cultural meaning of the original name is lost across borders . For example , Harry Potter and the Philospher 's Stone was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone for US audiences because the mythology / story surrounding the Philospher 's Stone is not part of popular US culture / common knowledge , so the name lost it 's meaning in the US and Sorcerer 's Stone was seen to make more sense . Lastly , brand names are sometimes changed because the name may have a different meaning in another culture which ( potentially ) has a negative or inappropriate connotation . For example , the Honda Fit was originally going to be called the Honda Fitta until it was discovered that ' Fitta ' roughly translates to ' pussy ' in many Nordic languages .

29,"The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client ?€?s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .",1,Reddit

Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing .

In an Infantry platoon it is the Platoon Sergeant 's job to maintain accountability of all men , weapons , and equipment . He does this by maintaining a MAL ( master authorization list ) given to him by the Company 's Armorer when weapons are signed out from the arms room . When a Soldier is injured or killed during combat operations he / she is put onto a MEDEVAC ( medical evacuation ) vehicle , whether it be a helicopter or some form of ground transportation . Prior to the Soldier being loaded all of his equipment is stripped off of him / her and retained by the unit . If the Soldier carried a crucial casualty producing weapon , like a machine gun with a higher rate of fire than the standard M4 , it will be given to the next most qualified person along with all the ammo . This is to try and maintain the combat effectiveness , AKA how many bullets you can throw at people , despite having less people . As for the gear , after it is recovered back to a FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) all gear that was worn by a casualty is inspected by people certified to determine whether it is serviceable . If an item is not serviceable and the casualty is still alive the inspectors will make an effort to send the item to the casualty 's home . It is not uncommon for Soldiers who received gunshots to their helmets to get to keep those for life . Enemy equipment is another story .

But back to your original question , what are the facial differences between men and women ? Sexual selection seems to be one of the key factors in later human development . determine the fundamental characteristics of each sex based on the needs and requirement of the opposite sex . For example , men tend to be larger , stronger and broader shoulders ; conversely women have wider hips , are shorter and have a higher fat to muscle ratios . These Characteristics are indicative that men historically have been considered the better fighters and women he better child carers , and in purely reproductive terms would have influenced the sexual selection of either sex , in laments terms men with more masculine features are more sexually desirable , and women with more feminine features are more sexually desirable . ( generally speaking ) However these selection characteristics have also influenced other arbitrary features that we have associated with better mates . I.e. men having wider , squarer jaw lines , and females having the converse . Women having "" softer "" facial features and men having "" harder "" facial features . This is n't an exact science and I based on generalizations , which in turn are based on social perceptions .

My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night .

93,"I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , "" yes , but you would n't really want to "" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .",1,Reddit

There was a phase of 16:10 monitors for computers , mine for instance is 1680x1050 , but mass production wins out and the decision to use the same resolution across TVs , laptops and monitors drove the price down .

Multiple reasons . One , the Renaissance was a big deal historically . It was for a long time seen as the awakening of humanity from the Dark Ages . A time of genius and art . This is not true for all of humanity , the Middle East and Asia were doing just fine during the "" Dark Ages "" but this misconception makes for the Renaissance being very important historically . Da Vinci is a well known Renaissance artist . He was just a bad ass , he was a great painter , an inventor , just an interesting person so his reputation makes his art valuable on it 's own . The Mona Lisa in particular is valuable because in 1911 it was stolen , it became worldwide news and suddenly the Mona Lisa was the most famous painting in the world . This popularity has just sort of stuck to the painting . There has to be one painting which is the most popular , it is the way of things , something has to be on top and the Mona Lisa just so happened to become that painting .",1,Reddit

With saturation advertising , there 's literally almost no direction I can look , right now , where I 'm sitting , and not see an advertisement for digital media . The whole point is the advertisers want you to feel that you want this product and you want it * now * , in order to induce a purchase . And they 're successful , at large , too successful , actually . The value of media is inflated , music and video is n't actually worth what they 're charging , as evidenced by the rampant piracy . The working class has n't had a pay raise in 22 years and has less buying power now than they did in the 1980s , cost of living increases , and the price of media has always been ~$15 for an album . And you get less today than ever . You used to get a cover , an insert , and art , bundled with the album . Today , you get an mp3 download . It costs fractions of a penny to digitize the final product and distribute it on the internet , you 'd think that would drop the price . It costs $ 0.017 to produce a CD , just as a point of reference , and digital distribution is orders of magnitude cheaper . So here you have a market who wants your product and wants it now , and ca n't or wo n't afford it . I 'm not saying it 's ok , but this is the catalyst that allows people to justify it . The way the industry works is an artist is contracted to produce content for the publisher , they do n't own their own songs , and they 're literally lucky if they get any money , at all , from the sale of their media . Artists make money by performing , and even then , they 're responsible for the cost of the production , which cuts into their profits . So publishers are seen as big , bad , rich , faceless corporations - profiteering gluttons who do n't need any more money for something they own but they did n't make , so fuck em ' , right ? The world is such a big place and so many people do buy the album that they wo n't even notice I stole a copy ... Or so the mindset goes .

162,"It is a theoretical model , that has been proven through experiment . Imagine someone gives you a gift . It is a hollow metal sphere but it is packaged in a box . You have no idea what the gift is , but decide to do some experiments to find out , without actually opening the box . First you shake the box and it moves around . This tells you it is relatively light . Then , knowing that it is light , you move it slowly and you feel it rolling . This tells you that it is probably round . Now you are trying to find out what it is made of . You apply heat to the box , then shake to see if it has melted but it has not . You suspect that it is a strong but light material , like a metal alloy - since initial shake tests did n't break it ca n't be brittle . So you decide to touch magnets to the surface of the box . The object does not move and stays attracted to the magnet . This tells you it is metallic . Since it is metallic and relatively light , you suspect , it is hollow . So , you poke a hole in the box , and fill it with water . Comparing the volume of the box , with the volume of water you filled will tell you the size of the object . From this , you can choose a metal - alloy based on the magnetic strength recorded and estimate how hollow it is . All this has been concluded , without actually seeing the sphere . Still , you can only speculate what colour the sphere is or whether it has dimples or not . But from the tests you carried out , you can pretty much acknowledge certain findings as fact . That 's sort of the process people like Rutherford used to determine the atomic model . As for being able to see it , I do n't think so . We have two types of microscope - Light microscope and Electron microscope . LM uses lightwaves ( duh ) and so objects too small to interfere with these waves can not be seen .

I do n't need to tell you what would happen if we tried to fire electrons at an atom ... but that 's beside the point .

170,"tl;dr : GIF is an image compression format , which is n't really suited well to compressing video data . Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says "" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . "" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs / live video . I did n't try to explain DCT / Quantization / entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate / coding issues . I think it is safe to say that GIF is a terrible video compression format , and that 's probably the root of many other issues . However , I have n't profiled browsers to see where they spend time decoding animated GIFs . I made a list of other places that could be inefficient [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . - Yeah , your "" five year old did n't understand this "" el - oh - el :P If my 7 - yr - old had the interest I 'd try to explain it to him and get his feedback , but I think he 'd rather play LEGO . --- EDIT 2 : A couple more things people are asking / mentioning : - Several people have mentioned HTML5 Video and WebM as alternatives to animated GIFs . There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is "" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? "" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .",1,Reddit

177,"Key Existential Concepts The meaninglessness of life , the absence of God , the loneliness of being a thinking individual ?€? it sounds like the existentialists were n't the happiest group of folks , right ? Not necessarily true . Read on to get an idea of what existentialism is all about . Absurdity : What human beings encounter when they come into contact with the world . Absurdity is brought about because the human instinct to seek order and meaning is frustrated by the refusal of the world to be orderly or meaningful . Anxiety : Kierkegaard said , "" Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom . "" You feel anxiety because you recognize that you and you alone are responsible for your actions . This produces the two - sided feeling of simultaneous dread and exhilaration . Alienation : The sense that you 're a stranger in the world , or a stranger to yourself . Many aspects of existence can be alienating . One of the primary sources is absurdity . Ironically , the stories and systems developed by philosophy and religion to address that absurdity can be just as alienating . Existence precedes essence : Sartre 's phrase to describe the existential situation humans find themselves in . It refers to the fact that when you 're born , you have no meaning , no purpose , no definition . Human beings exist first , and only later define themselves . The ??bermensch : The word Nietzsche uses to refer to his ideal human being . Literally "" overman , "" the word reflects the importance in his philosophy of overcoming ?€? overcoming traditional values , overcoming the herd mentality , and , most importantly , overcoming yourself . You overcome these things so that you might attain something greater . Nietzsche 's ??bermensch is an unconventional creator of values , a joyous free spirit , and one who embraces the earth instead of pining away for heaven . The death of God : The death of the notion that belief in God alone , or belief in any religious or philosophical system , is sufficient to provide human beings with the meaning , purpose , and definition they crave . It 's the recognition that , because no external system can provide you with the answers , you must take responsibility for providing them yourself . Subjectivity : Your first - person perspective on the world , including the needs , desires , and emotions that accompany that perspective . The existentialists take this as a valid and important starting point for genuinely human endeavors . This can be contrasted with the scientific mindset , which always starts with objectivity ?€? seeing people in impersonal , objective terms without emotion or appreciation for their individual point of view .",1,Reddit

A ' live DJ set ' involves the DJ constructing the song from pre - made samples or from creating the songs entirely from scratch , using sounds from a digital source ( e.g. Ableton ) and then augmenting the song they have made as they go along . The easiest analogy is between a musician playing their album from start to finish without stopping , but not improvising and a musician playing their songs with entirely new , improvised sections perhaps in a different order .

Obviously you can be detained and then committed to an institution but it 's not because its illegal but it 's under some other law that authorizes such actions if there is a reasonable belief someone is a danger to themselves or others . Granted a lot of the repercussions of this are similar to being arrested for illegal acts , being detained , held against your will in a facility , losing some rights etc . , but there 's also some differences such as not having a criminal record . Assisted suicide is illegal though , and that 's partially because the state does n't want to be involved in trying to determine if someone is guilty of murder or if they were just assisting suicide , and the other part being it 's stance against suicide anyhow . Even in states that have death with dignity acts , they 're not exactly assisted suicide .

Multiplying with 10 adds exactly 10 db . So you would hear all the people talking at 30 db . Another rule that is handy to now is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db . That means 2 people would make 23 db noise , 4 people 26 db and 8 people 29 db . In addition to that you can split larger numbers up for example multiplying by 80 ( for example 80 talking people ) would be 8 * 10 which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 and with the mentioned rules you get 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 19db more .
